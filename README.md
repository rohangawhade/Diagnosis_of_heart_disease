<h1># Diagnosis_of_heart_disease</h1>
The R project diagnoses the presence of heart disease.
<h4>Algorithm : Random Forest</h4>
<h4>Different features of columns in the file</h4>
<ol>
<li>age: age in years</li>
<li>sex: sex (1 = male; 0 =female)</li>
<li>cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)</li>
<li>trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hopsital)</li>
<li>choi: serum cholestoral in mg/dl</li>
<li>fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; = 0 false)</li>
<li>restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)</li>
<li>thalach: maximum heart rate achieved</li>
<li>exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)</li>
<li>oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest</li>
<li>slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)</li>
<li>ca: number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by flourosopy</li>
<li>thai: (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)</li>
<li>num: diagnosis of heart disease. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.</li>
